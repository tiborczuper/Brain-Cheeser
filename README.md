## 🎮 How to Play

To solve each challenge, place all cheese puzzle pieces on the game board to form a large square slice of cheese, with mice peeking through the holes:

- 🧩 Cheese pieces must not overlap mice or extend beyond the edge of the grid.
- 🕳️ Empty holes are allowed when two cheese pieces with cut-outs are placed side by side.
- 🚫 Half holes in the middle of the cheese are not permitted. They are only allowed at the edge of the board.

Each challenge has **only one correct solution**.
